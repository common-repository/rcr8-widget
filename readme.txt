== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I want to limit activities to only certain types =

Select the activities to limit in the search options by selecting them from the "Limit Activities To:" select options.  Shift or Ctrl or Cmd to select multiple options under the widgets control panel.    

= I want to default to the user's location instead of specifying a default location  =

Simply leaft the Default Location field blank and RCR8 will automagically switch to using the location of the browser.

= I'm getting no results when I know there are obviously results  =

The most common problem is that you have selected a default activity but limited activities to exclude the default activity.

= There are no activity listings in my area of interest or geography  =
